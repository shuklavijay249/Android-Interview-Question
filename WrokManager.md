# Android WorkManager

## What is WorkManager?
**WorkManager** is an Android library introduced as part of Android Jetpack for managing background tasks that need guaranteed execution, even if the app is closed or the device is restarted. Itâ€™s highly efficient for tasks that must be executed asynchronously and can be deferred or scheduled.

---

## Key Features of WorkManager:
- **Guaranteed execution**: Tasks are guaranteed to execute, even after the app is killed or the device is restarted.
- **Suitable for deferred tasks**: Ideal for tasks like syncing data, processing logs, or uploading files.
- **Task chaining**: Chain multiple tasks to execute in sequence or parallel.
- **Constraints support**: Schedule tasks with specific constraints such as network availability, device charging, etc.
- **Battery efficient**: Works within Android's power-saving features like Doze mode.
- **Backwards compatibility**: Works on Android 4.0 (API level 14) and higher.

---

## WorkManager API Components:
1. **WorkRequest**: Represents a request to perform some work. Types:
   - `OneTimeWorkRequest`: For one-off tasks.
   - `PeriodicWorkRequest`: For recurring tasks.
   
2. **Worker Class**: Define the work by extending the `Worker` class or `CoroutineWorker` for Kotlin coroutines.

3. **WorkManager**: Used to enqueue and manage work.

---

## WorkManager Example:

### 1. Add WorkManager Dependency
Add the following to your app's `build.gradle`:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.7.1"
}
```

### 2. Create a Worker Class
Create a `Worker` subclass where you define the task.
```kotlin
class UploadWorker(appContext: Context, workerParams: WorkerParameters) : Worker(appContext, workerParams) {
    override fun doWork(): Result {
        return try {
            // Simulate some work
            // uploadFileToServer()
            Result.success()
        } catch (exception: Exception) {
            Result.retry()  // Retry in case of failure
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Enqueue the WorkRequest
In your activity or fragment, create and enqueue a `WorkRequest`.
```kotlin
val uploadWorkRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<UploadWorker>()
    .setConstraints(
        Constraints.Builder()
            .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED) // Only run when connected
            .build()
    )
    .build()

WorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(uploadWorkRequest)
```

### 4. Monitor Work Status
You can observe the status of the work:
```kotlin
WorkManager.getInstance(context).getWorkInfoByIdLiveData(uploadWorkRequest.id)
    .observe(this, Observer { workInfo ->
        if (workInfo != null && workInfo.state.isFinished) {
            if (workInfo.state == WorkInfo.State.SUCCEEDED) {
                // Task succeeded
            } else {
                // Task failed or was cancelled
            }
        }
    })
```

---

## Common WorkManager Constraints:
- **Network availability**: `setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)`
- **Charging state**: `setRequiresCharging(true)`
- **Device idle state**: `setRequiresDeviceIdle(true)`
- **Battery not low**: `setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true)`

---

## WorkManager Use Cases:
- Uploading files or syncing data in the background.
- Logging and analytics data processing.
- Performing periodic maintenance tasks like cache cleaning or data backup.
- Completing operations even if the app is terminated, like scheduled notifications or alarms.

## Interview Questions on Android WorkManager:

### 1. What is WorkManager in Android? Why is it used?
**Answer**: WorkManager is an Android Jetpack library used to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are guaranteed to execute, even if the app is terminated or the device is rebooted.

### 2. How does WorkManager ensure task execution, even after an app is killed?
**Answer**: It uses various scheduling APIs (JobScheduler, AlarmManager) based on Android version and persists work requests in a database.

### 3. How does WorkManager handle periodic tasks?
**Answer**: Using `PeriodicWorkRequest` for tasks that need to repeat at regular intervals.
```kotlin
val periodicWorkRequest = PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder<UploadWorker>(1, TimeUnit.HOURS)
    .build()
WorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(periodicWorkRequest)
```
(Note: Minimum repeat interval is 15 minutes.)

### 4. What are the advantages of WorkManager over other background processing APIs like JobScheduler or AlarmManager?
- **Backwards compatibility**: Works on all Android versions from API 14 onward.
- **Constraints support**: Specify constraints for tasks.
- **Guaranteed execution**: Ensures tasks are executed even if the app is killed.
- **Chained tasks**: Allows you to chain tasks together.
- **Built-in retries**: Provides mechanisms for retrying failed tasks.

### 5. How do you monitor the progress of a WorkRequest in WorkManager?
**Answer**: Use `LiveData` from the `WorkManager` API:
```kotlin
WorkManager.getInstance(context).getWorkInfoByIdLiveData(workRequestId)
    .observe(this, Observer { workInfo ->
        if (workInfo != null) {
            if (workInfo.state.isFinished) {
                // Handle completion
            }
        }
    })
```

### 6. What are the different states a WorkRequest can have in WorkManager?
- **ENQUEUED**: The work is waiting to be executed.
- **RUNNING**: The work is currently being executed.
- **SUCCEEDED**: The work has completed successfully.
- **FAILED**: The work has failed permanently.
- **BLOCKED**: The work is blocked by its prerequisites.
- **CANCELLED**: The work has been cancelled.

### 7. Can WorkManager handle task chaining? How?
**Answer**: Yes, you can chain tasks using the `then()` method.
```kotlin
val firstWorkRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<FirstWorker>().build()
val secondWorkRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<SecondWorker>().build()

WorkManager.getInstance(context)
    .beginWith(firstWorkRequest)
    .then(secondWorkRequest)
    .enqueue()
```

### 8. How do you handle input and output data in WorkManager?
**Answer**: Use `Data` objects to pass data.
1. **Passing input data**:
   ```kotlin
   val inputData = workDataOf("key" to "value")
   ```
2. **Accessing input data in `doWork()`**:
   ```kotlin
   val value = inputData.getString("key")
   ```
3. **Returning output data**:
   ```kotlin
   val outputData = workDataOf("resultKey" to "resultValue")
   return Result.success(outputData)
   ```
4. **Accessing output data**:
   ```kotlin
   workInfo.outputData.getString("resultKey")
   ```

### 9. What is the role of `Constraints` in WorkManager?
**Answer**: `Constraints` define conditions under which a work request should be executed, like requiring Wi-Fi or charging.
```kotlin
val constraints = Constraints.Builder()
    .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.UNMETERED)
    .setRequiresCharging(true)
    .build()
```

### 10. Can you cancel a WorkRequest in WorkManager? How?
**Answer**: Yes, use `cancelWorkById()` or `cancelAllWorkByTag()`.
```kotlin
WorkManager.getInstance(context).cancelWorkById(workRequestId)
WorkManager.getInstance(context).cancelAllWorkByTag("uploadTag")
```
